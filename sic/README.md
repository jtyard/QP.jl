# SICs

Scripts for constructing, working with and otherwise studying SICs

So far only `sic2.jl` computes the rational solutions.  Magma successfully computed the dimension and other properties in d=4 as well as some solutions in higher dimensions, especially real ones.  Not quite working here yet but hopefully soon...
