# Magma scripts 

Some of these scripts work only in the context of a lost Magma session ran years ago in a VM somewhere.  Some were useful in constructing low-dimensional SICs both from explicit solutions and their defining equations, or for exploring related mathematical structures.  Others helped to answer a question or do some calculation I had on my mind at the time.  Some don't work.  

A goal is to enable similar computations in an improved open-source workflow in julia.
