# QP.jl - Quantum Programming



## Goals / desires
- Abstract framework for modeling quantum systems
- Explicit computing in bases 
- Implementation-agnostic (native julia, arb, FLINT, ..., TensorFlow)
- Fast computation of stabilizer/graph states 
- Parametric models / exponential families
- Solving pentagon and hexagon equations?
- [Arithmetic of quantum circuits](Arithmetic.md) for qubits and beyond
- Incorporate [type foundations](TypeFoundations.md) such at [HoTT](https://homotopytypetheory.org/)



## Informal proof systems?

*Informal* proof system as workflow for searching for proofs using machine learning.  From MATH 239 to current research in physics and mathematics.
- How to represent information?
  - Scraping arXiv / hep-th
  - *concept classifier* 
  - Can a computer "discover" math or physics?
  - A possible answer: Computer very good at doing calculations.  In what sense could we possibly ask a computer to "understand" the result?  Can it learn to recognize / read / learn from existing proofs?
- Supervised / unsupervised learning: 
  - Supervised: Teach it
  - Unsupervised: Computers can easily generate examples by doing calculations.   
 Like, have it look at a paper and try to verify little parts as a check on its understanding.  
  - Publishing - How does it record its understanding or otherwise label what it finds "interesting".
  - In addition to julia also consider rust and go.
