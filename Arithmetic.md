# Quantum circuit synthesis

- Oscar/Hecke, Magma
- Circuit synthesis quaternion algebras and beyond
- 2-sided ideal class group
  - `TwoSidedIdealClassGroup(OO)` in Magma
- Set $\mathrm{Pic}_\ell$ of equivalence classes of invertible right ideals under left equivalence. 
  - `RightIdealClasses(OO)`
- Number of conjugacy classes, or types (Clark) of orders
  - `#ConjugacyClasses(OO)`
- Hecke does one split prime.  `PolyMake.jl` for totally positive and more general?
